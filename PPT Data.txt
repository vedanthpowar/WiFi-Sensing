Sleep Solution
GOAL: Finding Sleep tracker’s trigger point.


MonoPHY: Mono-stream-based device-free WLAN localization 
Spot-Fi 
Multipath Triangulation

Requires :
Wi-Fi Chip on Target to be localized
Fingerprinting with specific Tx/Rx Arrangement


Whole-Home Gesture Recognition - https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9386235
Requires :
High Packet Rate up to 1000 Pk/sec
Doppler Shifts are of few Hz


Wi-Sleep: Sleep Monitoring


DensePose from Wi-Fi
Accuracy: 87.2%
Rate: 100 pk/sec
Localization Error:0.5m
Subcarrier: 30
Environment Specific


DeFi: Robust Training-Free Device-Free Wireless Localization With WiFi


Widar 2.0: Passive Human Tracking with a Single Wi-Fi Link
TOF + AOA + DFS
DFS Uniqueness requires minimum 200Hz Sampling Rate.
Our Sampling Rate is 33Hz, so maximum trackable speed is 
   0.99 m/s.
